      Ecliptex Trade Limited was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: to bridge the gap between farm-fresh produce and busy restaurant kitchens. Founded in 2024, our company has grown to a trusted name in the food service industry. Our journey began when Maria, a former chef, noticed the time and labour-intensive process of preparing vegetables in restaurant kitchens. She envisioned a service that could provide pre-cut, ready-to-use vegetables, allowing chefs to focus on creating culinary masterpieces rather than spending hours on prep work. John, with his background in supply chain management, saw the potential to streamline the process from wholesale markets to restaurant doors. A company dedicated to providing high-quality, freshly cut vegetables and custom salad boxes to restaurants of all sizes and cuisines.
