          >Ecliptex Trade Limited was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: to
          bridge the gap between farm-fresh produce and busy restaurant kitchens.
          Founded in 2024, our company has grown to a trusted name in the food
          service industry. Our journey began when Maria, a former chef, noticed
          the time and labour-intensive process of preparing vegetables in
          restaurant kitchens. She envisioned a service that could provide
          pre-cut, ready-to-use vegetables, allowing chefs to focus on creating
          culinary masterpieces rather than spending hours on prep work. John,
          with his background in supply chain management, saw the potential to
          streamline the process from wholesale markets to restaurant doors. A
          company dedicated to providing high-quality, freshly cut vegetables and
          custom salad boxes to restaurants of all sizes and cuisines.</span

        <span style="font-size: 12pt"
          >Our team of expert buyers visits wholesale markets daily to handpick
          the finest vegetables available. We have established strong
          relationships with trusted suppliers and local farmers, ensuring that we
          always have access to the best produce, even during seasonal
          fluctuations. We carefully select each vegetable based on freshness,
          quality, and adherence to our strict standards. Our buyers are trained
          to identify the perfect ripeness and condition for each type of produce,
          ensuring that our clients receive vegetables at their peak flavor and

      </h5>
      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 12pt"
          >Once the vegetables arrive at our facility, they undergo a rigorous
          cleaning and sanitization process. Our state-of-the-art washing systems
          remove dirt, debris, and potential contaminants, ensuring the highest
          level of food safety. Our processing area is equipped with cutting-edge
          technology, including automated cutting machines and manual stations
          operated by skilled staff. This combination allows us to handle large
          volumes of vegetables while maintaining the precision and care that
          certain produce items require. We maintain strict temperature control
          throughout our facility to preserve the freshness and quality of the
          vegetables. Our cold storage units are monitored 24/7 to ensure optimal
